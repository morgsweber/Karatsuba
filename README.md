# Karatsuba #

##### About the project

This repository was created to develop a university work on Algorithm Optimization using an adaptation of the Karatsuba algorithm. You can read more about the Karatsuba algorithm [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm), and you can find more information about the adaption in the T1 file in this repository. This algorithm use [Divide and Conquer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-algorithm-introduction/).

##### Requirements
